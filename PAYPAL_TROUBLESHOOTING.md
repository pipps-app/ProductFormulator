# PayPal Integration Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
PayPal sandbox credentials are returning "Client Authentication failed" despite being copied from the developer console.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. App Status Check
In your PayPal developer account:
- Ensure the PIPPS_Maker_Calc app status shows "Live" or "Active"
- Check if there are any pending reviews or approvals

### 2. Feature Configuration
Verify these features are enabled in your app:
- ✅ Checkout (required for one-time payments)
- ✅ Subscriptions (required for recurring billing)
- ✅ Vault (may be required for stored payment methods)

### 3. Sandbox Business Account
Ensure you have a sandbox business account linked:
- Go to Sandbox > Accounts
- Verify you have a business account (not just personal)
- The app should be linked to this business account

### 4. Re-generate Credentials
Sometimes credentials need to be regenerated:
- In your app settings, look for "Show" next to Client Secret
- Click "Generate" to create new credentials
- Copy the new values immediately

### 5. Environment Verification
Confirm you're in the correct environment:
- Top of page should show "Sandbox" toggle is ON
- URL should contain "developer.paypal.com" 
- Credentials should be from Sandbox tab, not Live

## Alternative Testing Approach

If credentials continue failing, we can:
1. Test the subscription system without PayPal initially
2. Deploy to production with PayPal integration disabled
3. Add PayPal once credentials are resolved
4. Use the working Shopify webhook integration for user provisioning

## Verification Steps

Try these in your PayPal account:
1. Apps & Credentials > PIPPS_Maker_Calc > Features tab
2. Verify "Checkout" and "Subscriptions" are checked
3. Save any changes
4. Regenerate credentials
5. Test again

The subscription system is otherwise fully functional and ready for deployment.
