# Manual Subscription Management Guide

## Overview

Your ProductFormulator application now uses a manual subscription management system where:
1. Users can request upgrades through the application
2. Admin receives email notifications of upgrade requests
3. Admin processes payments and activates subscriptions manually
4. Proration calculations are handled automatically

## How It Works

### For Users

#### 1. Requesting an Upgrade
- Users see "Upgrade" buttons in the Reports page when accessing higher-tier reports
- Clicking "Upgrade" takes them to the subscription page with the recommended plan highlighted
- Users can review plan details and click the upgrade button
- An upgrade request is sent to the admin team
- Users receive a confirmation email that their request was submitted

#### 2. What Users See
- **Immediate feedback**: "Upgrade request submitted successfully!"
- **Timeline**: "You'll receive payment instructions within 24 hours"
- **Expectation**: "Your upgrade will be activated immediately after payment"

### For Admins

#### 1. Receiving Upgrade Requests
- Admin receives email notifications when users request upgrades
- Email includes:
  - Customer information (email, company)
  - Current plan and requested plan
  - Upgrade amount calculation
  - Request timestamp

#### 2. Processing Upgrades
1. **Calculate Proration**: Use the built-in proration calculator
2. **Collect Payment**: Contact user with exact amount due
3. **Activate Upgrade**: Use admin panel to process payment and upgrade
4. **Confirm**: User gains immediate access to new features

## Proration Handling

### How Proration Works

When a user upgrades mid-cycle:
1. **Credit calculation**: Unused portion of current plan is calculated
2. **New plan charge**: Prorated amount for new plan until next billing date
3. **Net amount**: Difference between new charge and credit

### Example Proration Calculation

**Scenario**: User upgrades from Pro ($19/month) to Business ($65/month) on day 15 of 30-day cycle

```
Current plan credit: $19 Ã— (15 days remaining / 30 days) = $9.50
New plan charge: $65 Ã— (15 days remaining / 30 days) = $32.50
Net charge: $32.50 - $9.50 = $23.00
```

**Admin Action**: Collect $23.00 for immediate upgrade

### Using the Proration Calculator

The admin dashboard includes a proration calculator:

1. **Input current plan**: User's existing subscription tier
2. **Input new plan**: Requested upgrade tier
3. **Input billing cycle start**: When current plan began
4. **Input upgrade date**: When upgrade should take effect
5. **Get calculation**: Exact amount to charge customer
