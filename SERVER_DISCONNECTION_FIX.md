# Server Disconnection Issues - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## üîç **Problem Identified**
The server was experiencing frequent disconnections due to aggressive database connection timeout settings.

## üîß **Root Cause**
In `server/database-storage.ts`, the PostgreSQL connection pool was configured with very short timeouts:
- `idle_timeout: 10` - Connections closed after just 10 seconds of inactivity
- `connect_timeout: 5` - Only 5 seconds allowed for new connections
- `max: 5` - Limited connection pool size

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**
Updated the database connection configuration with more robust settings:

```typescript
const client = postgres(connectionString, {
  max: 10,                // Increased connection pool size (was: 5)
  idle_timeout: 300,      // Keep connections alive for 5 minutes (was: 10 seconds)
  connect_timeout: 30,    // Increased connection timeout to 30 seconds (was: 5)
  max_lifetime: 1800,     // Connection lifetime of 30 minutes (new)
  prepare: false
});
```

## üìã **What These Changes Do**

### 1. **Increased Connection Pool Size**
- **Before**: 5 maximum connections
- **After**: 10 maximum connections
- **Impact**: Reduces connection contention under load

### 2. **Extended Idle Timeout**
- **Before**: Connections closed after 10 seconds
- **After**: Connections kept alive for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Impact**: Prevents premature connection drops during normal usage

### 3. **Improved Connection Timeout**
- **Before**: 5 seconds to establish connection
- **After**: 30 seconds to establish connection  
- **Impact**: More resilient to network latency or temporary database load

### 4. **Added Connection Lifetime Management**
- **New**: 30-minute maximum connection lifetime
- **Impact**: Ensures connections are recycled to prevent stale connections

## üöÄ **Expected Results**
- ‚úÖ Significantly reduced disconnection frequency
- ‚úÖ Better handling of idle periods between requests
- ‚úÖ More stable connection pooling under varying load
- ‚úÖ Improved resilience to temporary network issues

## üéØ **Additional Monitoring Recommendations**

1. **Monitor Connection Pool Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Check for connection-related errors in logs
   grep -i "connection\|timeout\|disconnect" server.log
   ```

2. **Database Connection Health**:
   ```sql
   -- Monitor active connections in PostgreSQL
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

3. **Server Health Check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if server is responding
   curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/health || echo "Server down"
   ```

## üîÑ **Recovery Process**
If disconnections still occur:
1. Check PostgreSQL server status
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Review server logs for specific error patterns
4. Consider further increasing timeout values if needed

The server is now running with these improved settings and should experience much more stable connections.
