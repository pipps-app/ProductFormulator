# PayPal Sandbox Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The PayPal credentials are returning "Client Authentication failed" errors, indicating they may not be valid for the sandbox environment.

## Getting Correct Sandbox Credentials

### Step 1: Access PayPal Developer Portal
1. Go to **developer.paypal.com**
2. Log in with your PayPal business account

### Step 2: Create or Access Sandbox Application
1. Click **"My Apps & Credentials"** in the top menu
2. Make sure you're in the **"Sandbox"** tab (not Live)
3. If you don't have an app, click **"Create App"**
4. If you have an app, click on its name

### Step 3: App Configuration
When creating a new app:
- **App Name**: "Pipps Maker Calc" (or any name)
- **Merchant**: Select your sandbox business account
- **Product**: Check **"Checkout"** and **"Subscriptions"**
- Click **"Create App"**

### Step 4: Get Credentials
After creating/accessing the app:
1. You'll see **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
2. Make sure you're still in the **Sandbox** tab
3. Copy both values exactly as shown
4. Client ID should start with something like: `AQGKj7Vz...` (for sandbox)
5. Client Secret should be a long string

### Step 5: Verify Environment
**Important**: Sandbox credentials look different from live credentials:
- **Sandbox Client ID**: Usually starts with `AQ` or similar
- **Live Client ID**: Usually starts with `AT` or `AV`

Make sure you're copying from the **Sandbox** section, not Live.

## Common Issues

### Wrong Environment
- If you copied from "Live" instead of "Sandbox", the credentials won't work in development
- Always use Sandbox credentials for testing

### App Not Configured
- Ensure your app has "Checkout" and "Subscriptions" enabled
- The app status should be "Active"

### Copy/Paste Errors
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Copy the entire string including any trailing characters

## Testing Credentials
Once you have new credentials, I can immediately test them to verify they work with PayPal's sandbox API.

## Next Steps
1. Get fresh sandbox credentials following the steps above
2. Provide the new Client ID and Secret
3. I'll test the PayPal integration immediately
4. Deploy the working subscription system

Your subscription system is otherwise complete and ready - we just need valid PayPal sandbox credentials to enable payment processing.
